# Vue Store Project

This is a mini project made using Vue + Vite. 

Current features 

- basic ui
- dynamically fetched product data from DummyJSON
- routing done with vue-router
- basic basket mockup
- Supabase integration - registration, authentication and connection to a custom table, also super basic login
- user profile page - partially done, need to populate it with some more data


TODO:
- mock-up payments
- user profile page - make it make sense
- register/login - add some UI and visual feedback, so users know is happening
- sensible, consistent layout and color scheme - want something with blue as primary color this time
- include Pinia for a better-made basket management 
- replace placeholder images with more permanent ones
- finish up all minor pages, like contact
- properly design and test RWD
